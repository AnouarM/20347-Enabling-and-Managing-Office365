# Module 13: Planning and configuring identify federation
# Lab: Planning and configuring identity federation
  
### Scenario
  
Directory synchronization is working well, and it has resolved the issue of managing user accounts in two locations. However, the security group at A. Datum is concerned that users will be able to log on directly to Office 365, which reduces their options for monitoring user logons. To ensure that all users will authenticate using the on-premises AD DS domain, you have decided to implement AD FS.


### Objectives
  
After completing this lab, you should be able to:
- Install and configure AD FS and Web Application Proxy via Azure AD Connect.
- Verify that SSO is working.


Note: The lab steps for this course change frequently due to updates to Office 365. Microsoft Learning updates the lab steps frequently, so they are not available in this manual. Use the lab steps provided by the hosting partner when completing the labs in this course.

### Lab setup
  
Estimated Time: 60 minutes

Virtual machines:  **20347A-LON-DC1**, **20347A-LON-DS1**,  **20347A-LON-WAP1**, **20347A-LON-CL1**, and **20347-LON-CL3

User name:  **Adatum/Administrator**, **Adatum/Beth**

Password:  **Pa55w.rd**

In all tasks:
- Where you see references to  **Adatumyyxxxxx.onmicrosoft.com**, replace  **Adatumyyxxxxx** with your unique Office 365 domain name provided to you by your instructor.
- Where you see references to  **Adatumyyxxxxx.hostdomain.com**, replace the  **Adatumyyxxxxx** and **hostdomain** with your unique UPN name provided to you by your instructor.


This lab requires the following virtual machines:

- LON-DC1
    - Sign in as  **Adatum\\Administrator** using the password **Pa55w.rd**

- LON-DS1
    - Sign in as  **Adatum\\Administrator** using the password **Pa55w.rd**

- LON-WAP1
    - Sign in as  **Adatum\\Administrator** using the password **Pa55w.rd**

- LON-CL1
    - Sign in as  **Adatum\\Beth** using the password **Pa55w.rd**



## Exercise 1: Deploying Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS) and Web Application Proxy
  
### Scenario
  
A. Datum Corporation has decided to deploy AD FS and Web Application Proxy to provide SSO for Office 365. You will start the implementation by installing and configuring the AD FS and Web Application Proxy roles.

The main tasks for this exercise are as follows:

1. Add DNS records required for AD FS
2. Create an Office 365 administrator account
3. Configure and verify Azure AD Connect federation with AD FS



#### Task 1: Add DNS records required for AD FS
  
1. Sing-in to LON-DS1 as **Adatum\\Administrator** with the password **Pa55w.rd**.

2. Open a Windows PowerShell, and run  **IPConfig**. Record the server IP address.

3. On LON-DC1, open the DNS Manager.

4. In the  **Adatumyyxxxxx.hostdomain.com** zone, create a host record with a blank name using the external IP address provided to you by the hosting partner.

5. Create another host record with a blank name using the IP address for LON-DS1 that you recorded in Step 1.


#### Task 2: Configure and verify Azure AD Connect federation with AD FS
  
1. On LON-DS1, start Azure AD Connect

2. Update the configuration to add **Federation with AD FS** and the following settings:
    - Domain Administrator credentials
        - User name: **ADATUM\\Administrator**
        - Password: **Pa55w.rd**
    - Certificate provided by lab provider and installed on LON-DS1
    - Subject name: Matches certificate
    - Subject name prefix: **Adatumyyxxxx**
    - AD FS Server: **LON-DS1**
    - Web Application Proxy server: **LON-WAP1**
    - AD FS service account: **Create a group Managed Service Account**
    - Azure AD Domain: **Adatumyyxxxxx.hostdomain.com**

3. Verify that AD FS server address resolves in DNS.


## Exercise 2: Verifying single sign-on (SSO)
  
### Scenario
  
You need to verify that identity federation is properly configured by verifying that SSO authentication is successful for internal and external users.

The main tasks for this exercise are as follows:

1. Verify SSO for internal users

2. Verify SSO for external users


#### Task 1: Verify SSO for internal users
  
1. On LON-CL3, open Microsoft Edge, and then connect to  **https://portal.office.com**.

2. Type  **beth@adyyxxxxx.hostdomain.com**, and verify that you are redirected to the Adatum sign in page.

3. Sign in as Beth and verify that you can connect to Office 365 using the password **Pa55w.rd**.

4. Close Microsoft Edge.



#### Task 2: Verify SSO for external users
  
1. Open a Web browser on your local computer and navigate to  **https://login.microsoftonline.com**.

2. Sign in with the following credentials:
    - User name:  **Grover@Adatumyyxxxxx.hostdomain.com**
    - Password:  **Pa55w.rd**

3. Verify that you are redirected to the Adatum Corporation sign-in page.

4. Review the Office 365 page for Grover Chambliss, and then close the Web browser window.


>  **Result**: After completing this exercise, you should have verified SSO authentication to Office 365 for a user on your corporate network and for a user on your host computer that is connected to the Internet.
